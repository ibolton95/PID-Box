## Description  
In this project I will make a PID box with six sides, a motor, an LCD, and a rotating wheel. Lights and the LCD will turn on when a swtich is flipped, and another switch will turn on a motor. Turning a dial will turn on the motor, and the RPM of the wheel on the motor will be tracked and diplayed on the LCD along with the desired RPM.
